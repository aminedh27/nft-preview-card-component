## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While solving this challenge I learned how to really work with flex and using it in real time projects, this challenge helped a lot on the understanding of how css works

these are some code that I wrote by my self without any help


```css
.text {
  color: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.NFTcard {
  background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
  width: 25vw;
  height: 80vh;
  border-radius: 25px;
  padding: 30px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px hsl(217, 54%, 9%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will be focusing on learning how to make my CSS code responsive and works on any device and also when to use the explicit and implicit units
